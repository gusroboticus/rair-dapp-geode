      `On January 7, 2018, I was robbed of $24.7 million in digital assets by
      a criminal gang known variously as “The Community” or “the Pinsky
      Gang” after its 15-year-old ringleader, Ellis Pinsky. The crime would
      not have been possible without the porous security systems and
      improper supervision of employees and contractors at AT&T, which the
      gang was able to penetrate by bribing AT&T store employee Jahmil Smith
      to put false entries into the AT&T computer system indicating that he
      was transferring control of my phone number to me in a store in
      Connecticut, when I was thousands of miles away in Las Vegas. Instead,
      he sent the control of my phone number, which in effect is one’s
      digital identity, without my permission, to the gang members in and
      around New York City. This scenario has happened hundreds, perhaps
      thousands of times, and yet to date AT&T denies any responsibility for
      its role in this blatant assault on personal freedoms, consumer
      privacy and data protection.`

      `On August 15, 2018, I sued AT&T in Federal Court in Los Angeles for
      $24.7 million in damages, plus $200 million in punitive damages,
      resulting in worldwide attention. AT&T has spent a lot of time and
      money trying to bury me in paperwork and motions, but the case has
      proceeded to depositions and to a docketed trial date in Los Angeles
      in May, 2023.`

      `This NFT sale is designed to help me continue the fight, no matter how
      long it takes (I’ve been at this for nearly five years and have spent
      over $3 million in attorneys fees to date). I also want attention to
      my case, as well as to the lack of regulation and protection of
      consumers, which I first pursued with an open letter the Federal
      Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in October, 2019 (and my case
      was mentioned in currently proposed rule changes put forth in 2021 to
      protect consumers – which AT&T is fighting).`
