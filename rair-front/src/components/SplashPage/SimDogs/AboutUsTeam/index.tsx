    aboutTeammate: [
      'Andre Miripolsky is an artist of extraordinary creative abilities. As colorful a man as the exuberantly colorific art he creates, his signature style of pop imagery is bright, whimsical, energetic, and downright fun. A true multi-media artist, Andre is much more than a painter, taking his unique pop-style into sculpture, mobiles, graphics, branding, production design, sets and costumes, and now, NFTs. His sense of humor has been embraced by film and music stars, creating several art costumes for Sir Elton John - most notably the often-photographed “Piano Jacket” made for the famous Central Park concert. He has also collaborated on projects for Bette Midler, Quincy Jones, Robin Williams, the Rolling Stones, MTV, and Mattel, where he was commissioned to create a one-of-a-kind “Miripolsky Art Barbie.” From 1997-2004 he painted huge scenic sets and floors for the music segments of “The Tonight Show” with Jay Leno, making history as the first visual artist ever commissioned to create original scenic art. He also made basketball history in 1992 by painting a 6000 sq. ft. mural directly on UCLA’s center court at Pauley Pavilion for MTV’s Rock and Jock B-Ball Jam. His famous “Fear No Art” button has been sold continuously at LACMA since 1985 and was once carried in over 300 museums.'

    aboutTeammate: [
      `RAIR is a blockchain — based digital rights management platform that uses NFTs to gate access to streaming content. Data monopolies like Amazon, YouTube, Google, Apple, and Netflix charge onerous fees, offer opaque analytics, and can change their terms of service at any time locking out creators and users alike. DIY distribution meanwhile offers no protection, and cannot help package works into a scarce, valuable, tradeable framework.`,
      `RAIR empowers anyone to create unique, controllable, and transferable digital assets tied to the actual underlying content.`
