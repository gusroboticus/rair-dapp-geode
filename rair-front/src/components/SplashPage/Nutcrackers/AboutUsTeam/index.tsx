    aboutTeammate: [
      `Nut Cranksy is a pseudonymous Florida-based  artist, graphic designer, 
              and author whose real name and identity remain the subject of speculation.
              The jovial nutcracker art combines humor and the playful dress-up of an old
              wooden holiday classic. Active since the late 2000s, currently, in the NFT
              space, bringing back to life some older works inspired and applying them 
              to be minted and expressed. Our work has all been "Work Made for Hire" for
              various corporate to mom and pop retail to startups. Mc Cranksy work grew
              out of consistency and grit, and finally, just start putting all the art
              out there. More projects are coming down the pipeline â€”stay tuned.`
