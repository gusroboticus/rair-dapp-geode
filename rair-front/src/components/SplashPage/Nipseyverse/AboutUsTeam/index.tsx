    aboutTeammate: [
      `Over the past two decades, Mr. Lee’s soulful and synth heavy sound
              has not only been emulated, but has allowed him to rack up 9 platinum
              albums, 6 gold albums and singles on the radio for 13 consecutive years.
              He has had the opportunity to work with an array of artists including
              Paul Wall, Slim Thug, Mary J. Blige, and Dwele. Now currently working 
              with LL Cool J, he hopes his new XMG label will not only help break 
              on-the-rise stars King Shaun and Adonia, but serve as a hub for new
              artists to be heard in the future.`,

      `Mr. Lee worked closely with Nipsey on his 2018 album Victory Lap. 
              His relationship with the late rapper trascended artist/producer 
              into a deep friendship of mutual respect. Lee retains many personal 
              messages and recordings between himself and Nipsey which he plans 
              to make thoughtfully available to the Nipseyverse when the time is
               right.`

    aboutTeammate: [
      `The Neighborhood Nip Foundation is an initiative that seeks to provide
              opportunities for young creatives in music. The late rapper, who died
              in early March of 2019 after being shot & killed outside of his clothing
              store in Los Angeles, was known for his philanthropic efforts towards his 
              community and neighborhood. As Nipsey’s brother, Sam Asghedom, told the Los
              Angeles Times, the new foundation will “be aligned with everything Nip
              believed in and what helped him”.`,

      `The foundation is mainly inspired by Nipsey’s own time spent at LA’s 
              Watts Towers, which provided a free music program to the rapper during his 
              youth. “We used to talk a lot about [what the Watts Towers program] meant to
              him,” Asghedom said. “A push, a little help can go a long way, and that’s 
              what this foundation will 100 percent be about.”`
