This script is intended for "easy" use of admin tools in a locally deployed rairnode.
Due to the way admin credentials are used in the production applicaton, it is difficult 
to make changes to the database through API calls. This means we have to do it manually
in order to gain use of admin functions. There is probably another way around this, but this
script is simply intended to allow for quick developer use. Some thinga re a little hacky at 
the moment. But it does the trick. If there are any issues please contact Zeph.

The process is as follows:

First and foremost, use of this script requires ownership of an NFT which can be referenced for 
admin privleges. Any NFT will do. But make note of the network it was minted on as thats must 
be supplied to "admin_nft_chain" variable in the main .env file of the rair repository. 

Next, a new user must be added to the database and that user object must contain references to our 
developer Ethereum address and the NFT we wish to use as our adminNFT. The quickest way 
to do this is by way of Postman and the RAIR Postman Collection (located in rair/assets/postman).
See the Confluence article titled "Local Deployment" for instructions on how to set up and use the
desktop version of Postman.

We can now run update_local_admin.sh. Supply the script with the proper data. Once complete, 
we should be able to access the admin tools in our local deployment. Point the browser to localhost, 
and if logged in to metamask, logout and then login again. The admin tools should now be accessible.
